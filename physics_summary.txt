In the introduction to Matthew Raspanti's book, it is explained that physics is the science that deals with matter, energy, motion, and force. It seeks to understand how the fundamental building blocks of the universe interact and aims to answer questions about the world we live in and the laws of nature. Physics has had a significant impact on society, with applications in technology, telecommunications, power, and space travel. The relevance of physics is evident in various aspects of our lives, including the threat of nuclear holocaust and government funding for scientific ventures. The complexity of physics concepts, its use of advanced mathematics and symbolism, and the sophistication of its instruments make it intimidating to many people. However, understanding physics is essential in our modern times, as it is a profound achievement of the human mind and has implications for our understanding of reality.
"Physics for Beginners 2" is a book that aims to provide a basic and non-mathematical understanding of physics to beginners who have no prior scientific or mathematical background. The book offers an overview of physics in a semi-historical sequence, presenting new concepts in an accessible manner and supported by necessary background information. It also includes biographical sketches of major figures in physics to add interest. While the book cannot read like a novel, it presents the story of physics as an intriguing detective novel, where seemingly insignificant details can become crucial clues to later discoveries. The book omits complex math and focuses on the essential concepts, striking a balance between providing enough depth without overwhelming the reader. It covers topics such as ancient astronomy, the laws of motion, energy, atoms, and molecules.
Chapter 1 of the book serves as an introduction to the topics covered in subsequent chapters. The author discusses particles in motion, waves, light, and electromagnetism in chapters 2-9 as foundational concepts. These concepts are followed by a discussion of the two fundamental theories of contemporary physics, relativity and quantum mechanics, in chapters 10-17. Chapter 18 provides a summary of the fundamental particles of matter and the forces that govern their interactions. Finally, chapter 19 offers a cosmic perspective on the origin, evolution, structure, and future of the universe as a whole, based on prevailing scientific theories.
