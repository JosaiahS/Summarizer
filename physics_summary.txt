This chapter of Matthew Raspanti's book introduces the concept of physics and its importance in society. Physics is defined as the science that studies matter, energy, motion, and force, and it seeks to understand the fundamental laws of nature. The applications of physics, such as transistors, microchips, and space travel, are pervasive in our daily lives. The threat of nuclear holocaust and the need for government funding of scientific ventures also highlight the relevance of physics. Despite its importance, physics is often seen as intimidating due to its difficult concepts, advanced mathematics, and complex instruments. However, a basic understanding of physics is necessary in today's world.
"Physics for Beginners 2" is a book aimed at intelligent individuals with no scientific or mathematical background who are interested in learning about physics. It provides a basic, non-mathematical overview of physics in a concise and reader-friendly style. The book follows a semi-historical sequence and includes biographical sketches of major figures in physics. While it is impossible to write a physics book that reads like a novel, the book presents the story of physics as an intriguing detective novel, where small details eventually become crucial clues to later discoveries. The book omits math and most of the material to simplify the subject, but strikes a balance between depth and accessibility. It covers topics such as ancient astronomy, laws of motion, energy, atoms, and molecules. Overall, the book serves as an introduction to physics for motivated beginners and can also act as a stepping stone to more advanced popular books on the subject.
