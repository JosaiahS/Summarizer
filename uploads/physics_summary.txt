This chapter is an introduction to the field of physics. It explains that physics is the science that deals with matter, energy, motion, and force, and seeks to understand the fundamental laws of nature. The chapter highlights the relevance of physics in our daily lives, with applications ranging from technology to space travel. It also emphasizes the importance of having at least some level of literacy in physics, as it is a profound achievement of the human mind. However, the chapter acknowledges that physics can be intimidating due to its difficulty, use of advanced mathematics, and complex instruments. Despite this, it asserts that understanding physics is essential, as it provides insights into the nature of reality.
"Physics for Beginners 2" is a book aimed at motivated beginners who have no prior scientific or mathematical background but are interested in learning about physics. The book provides a basic, non-mathematical presentation of physics, covering various concepts in a semi-historical sequence. The author includes biographical sketches of some major figures in physics to add depth to the narrative. While the book omits complex math and detailed material, it aims to strike a balance between going into enough depth to provide understanding while keeping the material accessible. The book starts with ancient astronomy and laws of motion and progresses to cover topics such as energy, atoms, and molecules. Overall, the book aims to provide a concise overview of physics and its historical development while appealing to a general audience.
Chapter 1 introduces the topics covered in the book, including particles in motion, waves, light, and electromagnetism. These serve as a foundation for the fundamental theories of relativity and quantum mechanics explored in later chapters. Chapter 18 summarizes the fundamental particles of matter and the forces that govern their interactions. Finally, chapter 19 provides a cosmic perspective on the origin, evolution, structure, and future of the universe.
